Title: Bookend The Day With Routines
Category: better human
Kind: article

Lately I have been honing in on my routines. This started with the idea of focusing on one habit each month. The first habit I developed was doing a daily morning walk. Since starting, I have habitually gone for a walk each and every morning. And I love it!

### Building Habits

I have been struggling with my habit this month. I am trying to meditate every day, and I have failed more often than not. [This post](http://artofmanliness.com/2011/09/05/bookend-your-day-the-power-of-morning-and-evening-routines/) on The Art of Manliness made me think about developing my morning and evening routines to build my habit each month.

### My Routines

Thinking through my routines today, I created three lists:

* Ideal Morning and Evening Routine
* First Step Morning and Evening Routine
* Current Morning and Evening Routine

Moving backwards made me realize how far I have to go to reach my ideal routines! Right now my evening routine is nonexistent. So, I have some work to do.

### Baby Steps

When building habits, taking small steps is the only way to success. I also created some **rules** for the morning and evening I have to stick by, regardless of where I am in my routine. This will help me address worries I had (feeling rushed meditating, looking at internet too long at night, etc.).

#### Morning Routine

My morning routine will look like this starting tomorrow:

* Walk
* Write [750 words](http://750words.com)
* Eat Real Food (Meat and Veggies) & Clean Dishes
* ***Meditate***
* Teeth Care (Floss/Brush)
* Dress, Etc.

The only new thing here is meditation. I am also switching the order of eating and writing my 750 words. I have found it a bit hard to write after eating, I seem to get easily distracted by the internet during eating and that delay's my writing.

##### Morning Rules:

1. No internet until 750 words are written.
2. Clean dishes before meditation.
3. Start meditation by 7:30am.
4. Determine topic for evening writing (during 750 words).

My morning routine has been pretty stable over the last year. Whenever I add stuff in (morning walk), it seems pretty easy for me to get it done. I have a lot of willpower in the morning!

#### Evening Routine

On the other hand, I struggle with my evening routine. Between having a varied schedule for dinner, cooking, crossfit, or going out and not being sure what I want to do - I end up spending a lot of time just surfing the internet.

I hope by establishing a list of things I **must** do and times for when things to be done, I can do a better job of this. This list is going to be much shorter because I am just jumping into the whole evening routine thing. Baby steps!

* Clean up dishes after dinner
* ***Focused writing on a single topic***
* Review goals, habits, day, life
* Read

The focused writing is something new. I always *intend* to write a blog at night, but find it hard to figure out the topic and then focus. That is where morning rule #3 comes in!

The other items in this list are things I have done with some regularity. But I hope to do them daily now (off and on...).

##### Evening Rules:

1. No electronics after 8pm.
2. Start review by 8:30pm.
3. Clean all dishes, put away clothes, etc, before reviewing goals.

Thats it! I have a ways to go to reach my ideal routine. For now, one step is enough.
