Title: About Joe

This page needs to be updated. For now please see my [CV]({filename}/pages/cv.md).

<hr>

I am interested in open data, community driven-development, maps, biking, and a few other things.

* Spent seven and a half years biking and getting wet in [Portland, OR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PC5PDlKKIo). 
* I managed data visualization projects at [Periscopic](http://periscopic.com) with clients including the Unicef, Yahoo!, GE, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Hewlett Foundation. 
* Originally, I moved to Portland to attend [Reed College](http://reed.edu) where I majored in Economics and Math. 
* I wrote my [senior thesis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/joehand_blog/Hand_ReedSeniorThesis_2009.pdf) on an economic model fueled by creative destruction, a topic that still interests me.

I spend my time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/joehand), cooking, [writing Python](https://github.com/joehand), lifting kettlebells, and walking outside.

## About This Website<a name="about-site"></a>

This site runs on [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com), [see the code on GitHub](https://github.com/joehand/joeahand). It is served on GitHub Pages, via [CloudFare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) ([with easy & free SSL](https://sheharyar.me/blog/free-ssl-for-github-pages-with-custom-domains/)).

**Homepage**: Most of the homepage data is stored in Google Docs (via [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com), [this tutorial](http://jlord.us/blog/your-own-instagram.html), and [a custom Pelican plugin](https://github.com/joehand/joeahand/tree/master/plugins/pelican_gdocs)). Data is processed on the server (so I hope the website is fast). I have a cron job to generate the site daily (and get my GitHub streak up).

**Charts**: Coffee chart is made using a `<table>`, CSS, and lots of Joe. Daily Steps chart is made with the [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.html) library.

**Design**: The Fonts are Garamond and Open Sans, served from Google. I used [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/layouts/) as my css foundation.
