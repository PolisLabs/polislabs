Title: About Joe

I am interested in open data, community driven-development, maps, biking, and a few other things.

I work with the Santa Fe Institute as the project manager for the Informal Settlements Project led by Dr. Luis Bettencourt. SFI, the Gates Foundation, and Slum/Shack Dwellers International joined together for this project. The project aims to create a worldwide slums database. 

As project manager I am leading the development of a data collection, analysis, and visualization platform to be used in informal settlements worldwide. I am also preparing data collected over the past ten years for further research and analysis.

* Spent seven and a half years biking and getting wet in [Portland, OR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PC5PDlKKIo). 
* I managed data visualization projects at [Periscopic](http://periscopic.com) with clients including the Unicef, Yahoo!, GE, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Hewlett Foundation. 
* Originally, I moved to Portland to attend [Reed College](http://reed.edu) where I majored in Economics and Math. 
* I wrote my [senior thesis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/joehand_blog/Hand_ReedSeniorThesis_2009.pdf) on an economic model fueled by creative destruction, a topic that still interests me.

I spend my time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/joehand), cooking, [writing Python](https://github.com/joehand), lifting kettlebells, and walking outside.
