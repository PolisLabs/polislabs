Title: About Joe

#### Santa Fe Institute: <small>Program Manager</small>

I joined the Santa Fe Institute as the project manager for the Informal Settlements Project led by Dr. Luis Bettencourt. I have always been fascinated with cities and recognize the importance of understanding the development of slums and cities for the future of humanity.

SFI, the Gates Foundation, and Slum/Shack Dwellers International joined together for this project. The project aims to create a worldwide slums database. Building on data collected from over 7,000 settlements in the last five years we will create a new data pipeline to increase the data collection capabilities. We will also leverage the data collected to understand how informal settlements grow and relate to the surrounding cities.

As project manager I am leading the development of a data collection, analysis, and visualization platform to be used in informal settlements worldwide. I am also preparing data collected over the past ten years for further research and analysis.

Previously, I spent seven and a half years biking and getting wet in [Portland, OR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PC5PDlKKIo).  I moved to Portland to attend [Reed College](http://reed.edu) where I majored in Economics and Math. I wrote my [thesis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/joehand_blog/Hand_ReedSeniorThesis_2009.pdf) on an economic model fueled by creative destruction, a topic that still interests me. More recently, I managed data visualization projects at [Periscopic](http://periscopic.com) with clients including the Unicef, Yahoo!, GE, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Hewlett Foundation.
