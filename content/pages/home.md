I help create knowledge from information & data. More specifically, I am bringing community data collection tools to informal settlements worldwide at the [Santa Fe Institute](http://santafe.edu), in collaboration with [Slum/Shack Dwellers International](http://www.sdinet.org/) and the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/). We are also researching the role of slums and informal settlements in cities and their development, leveraging data from over [6,000 settlements](http://civitas.santafe.edu/viz/).

Previously, I spent seven and a half years biking and getting wet in [Portland, OR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PC5PDlKKIo).  I moved to Portland to attend [Reed College](http://reed.edu) where I majored in Economics and Math. I wrote my [thesis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/joehand_blog/Hand_ReedSeniorThesis_2009.pdf) on an economic model fueled by creative destruction, a topic that still interests me. More recently, I managed data visualization projects at [Periscopic](http://periscopic.com) with clients including the Unicef, Yahoo!, GE, the Economic Policy Institute, and the Hewlett Foundation.

I spend my time [reading](https://readmill.com/hand), cooking, writing [Python](https://github.com/joehand), lifting kettlebells, and walking outside.
