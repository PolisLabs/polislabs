I am a developer, researcher, and open data enthusiast. I've worked with international communities, open source developers, researchers, and data visualiaztion & mapping experts to create community data and open source technology to solve local problems.

Currently, I am working with the [Santa Fe Institute](http://santafe.edu/research/informal-settlements/) bringing community data collection tools to informal settlements worldwide, in collaboration with [Slum/Shack Dwellers International](http://www.sdinet.org/).
