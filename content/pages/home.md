Joe Hand is a developer, researcher, and advocate of using community data and open source technology to solve local problems. He has worked with international communities, open source developers, researchers, and data visualiaztion & mapping experts.  

<!-- I create knowledge from information & data. I help bringing community data collection tools to informal settlements worldwide at the [Santa Fe Institute](http://santafe.edu), in collaboration with [Slum/Shack Dwellers International](http://www.sdinet.org/) and the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/). We are also researching the role of slums and informal settlements in cities and their development, leveraging data from over [6,000 settlements](http://civitas.santafe.edu/viz/).

I spend my time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/joehand), cooking, writing [Python](https://github.com/joehand), lifting kettlebells, and walking outside. -->
