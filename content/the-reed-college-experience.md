Title: The Reed College Experience
Category: note
Kind: note

The Reed College experience is often hard to capture. The latest Reed Magazine has a great history of the Reed experience and how it came to be. At Reed you "think about thinking" and learn reasoning by doing. During the process you realize “you are not your ideas, but merely a holder of your ideas.” But this all relies on a open process that does not define a starting and ending point:

> "If, on some level, we know what the learning system wants from us—say, by the use of grades as feedback on a defined path toward earning a degree to enter a specific career—we can erect certain internal defenses that allow us to choose how much of ourselves we give away to the system. But when the contract with the system is as existential as learning for the sake of learning, and progress is measured more qualitatively than quantitatively, we are apt to lose some of our psychic protections, allowing the system to get more deeply into our heads."
