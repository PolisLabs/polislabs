    <article class="content">
      <p>I began a new job with the Santa Fe Institute a few weeks ago. With a new job comes many changes. One change that I am very excited about is the chance to finally use a standing desk.</p>
<p>I have always been averse to spending all of my working hours sitting at a desk. I tried simple solutions like taking lots of breaks or using an exercise ball but that never solved the problem itself, sitting. Sitting caused my hip flexors and hamstrings to shorten which has been a continual source of pain and injury for me. I spent lots of time doing exercises to mitigate the effects but they always felt fruitless after spending eight hours a day sitting. The solution was staring at my face for ages, a standing desk.</p>
<p>I continued to read article after article of the benefits of a standing desk but I could never convince my employer to allow me a standing desk. Once I started at the Santa Fe Institute I asked during my orientation whether that was an option. I was lucky enough to procure the only standing desk in the facility. Even luckier for me, the desk is adjustable!</p>
<p>Similar to sitting, the ergonomic set up is important - perhaps even more so with standing. I am still working out the subtleties. I have the desk at the right height; the monitor may need some adjustment.</p>
<p>My biggest worry so far is my feet, especially with my achilles issue. The floor is carpeted. I wear my <a href="http://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/mens/gobi-black.html">vivo barefoot</a> shoes to work (highly recommended shoes) so there is minimal padding there, by design. I think the barefoot style shoes are important but I may have to invest in a more padded surface to stand on.</p>
<p>So now begins my standing desk experiment. I am monitoring my time standing/sitting using the <a href="http://www.standingclock.com/">standing clock</a>. I have also been taking daily measurements of my weight so I will use that as a quantitative measure of the effects along with my qualitative observations. I look forward for what is to come!</p>
