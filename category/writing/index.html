                        <div class="entry-content"> <p><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a> writes great articles about technology and management; his writing is something I admire. Looking through the <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/">post archives</a> on his site is overwhelming but also motivating. Scrolling to the bottom you pass a total of 460 posts over the course of twelve years &mdash; this is the overwhelming part. When you finally make it to the bottom you see the motivating bit, the first group of posts from 2002. Here are the titles for the Rands' first four posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Entry</li>
<li>No Title</li>
<li>No Title</li>
<li>No Title</li>
</ul>
<p>Like many of us, Rands started from scratch and started simply. He did not have a brilliant series of first posts. But he started and kept taking step after step. Through practice he became a great blogger. The graph below shows that his first few years he put in the most work on the blog, but after that he cruised at around 20 posts per year.</p>
<p><img alt="Posts Per Year on Rands in Repose" src="https://joehand_blog.s3.amazonaws.com/imgs/writing-matters-Rands-posts.png" /></p>
<p>The amount of writing he did in the first three years is impressive. What what his motivation? Solving problems, making things happen, communicating ideas. In his first post he declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IF YOU DON’T WRITE IT DOWN IT NEVER HAPPENED.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Writing Matters</h3>
<p>In this world of realtime video and immediate communication technology, it is odd to think that writing is important. But it is actually more important now than ever. The medium of writing used to be confined to books and papers or similar one-time productions. Now writing is rampant. Most communication now happens with writing (emails, tweets, texts, comments) where it used to be dominated by in-person meetings or calls. More people can publish their writing than ever before, with just the click of a button. Now, more than ever, it is crucial to be able to communicate through the written word.</p>
<p>Writing is important not just to communicate to others, but to communicate with yourself. Writing allows you to save ideas, build on them, create a comprehensive story around a single subject. Writing down ideas creates building blocks. You craft one part of your argument at a time until you have a cohesive structure. This is nearly impossible to do in your head alone. The act of writing itself helps to explore your idea.</p>
<p>Much later in Rands’ writing career he wrote about <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/why-you-should/">why you should weblog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise your ability to express yourself in words.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’ve chosen to use the web as a means of gathering new ideas. It is a non-trivial ability to take that drunken thought you had last Thursday and translate it a compelling argument that folks should talk about. Writing takes time and practice and time and practice.</p>
<p>When you create a space in your life for a weblog, you’re saying, “Writing matters.” You may not give a shit about writing, you may want to tell the world how much you think are physics is really cool, but to do so, you will need to write coherently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have taken advantage of the writing of others to learn and create a better life for myself. I recognized that  <strong><em>writing matters</em></strong>. And finally, I am going to do something about it.</p>
<p>This is the first step, a first post. And I need to take step after step once this is done and continue to build on this idea that writing matters, because <em>writing takes time and practice and time and practice.</em> Like Rands, I hope someday I can scroll through my lengthy archives, look at this first post, and laugh at how far I have come.</p> </div><!-- entry-content -->
